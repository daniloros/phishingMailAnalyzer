The van, which will be stopping at schools,\nlibraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free\nhigh-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are\nalready in the public domain.--------I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and\nsaw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a\nsmall satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding\nmachine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a\ncopy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total\nfixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA\nhad the equipment donated) is under $10k.One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if\nthey wished, add these \"virtual holdings\" (public domain materials) to their\nexisting library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be\ncompelling to small libraries in remote areas.- Jim\n",

I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed \n    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. \"The FBI wouldn't \n    waste resources on that,\" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would \n    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel \n    illegal. Becauseï¿½and this is the point of all that war-driving and \n    -chalking and node-stumblingï¿½when you get used to wireless, the experience \n    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe \n    bandwidth like oxygenï¿½and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our \" global remove list \" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",

Thanks, Google.*The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician\nLonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to\nreflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of\nutensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his\nplace in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of\nyen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life\n(\"panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters\nadvised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead\")\nand also at\nhttp://xsls.com?80\n(\"to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan\").*UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary\nfellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr\nNoam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society\nawarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an\ninsult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were\ngiven *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky\napparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted\nsongs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an\nadmirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy\nor contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also\nappreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:\nhttp://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoamVery special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for\nthis one.*Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-\nBudget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those\ncash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their\nIrish presence was as permanent and impressive as \"the world's\nleading risk and insurance services firm\", he concludes:\nhttp://www.marsh.ie\n(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)*Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring\nEircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against\nEircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this\ncountry.

And so on.*We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which\nis so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring\nabout the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one\nnewsletter.We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness\nof the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets\nstarting at \"just E50\" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The\nadvertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on \"the most\nbeautiful women in the world\" who will grace the Simmonscourt\nPavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl\nand Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.\nYou have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press\nads to divine that it's the \"new Escada Collection\" (the who now?)\nthey're modelling.

It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a\ncreation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to\nheady new heights.Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla\nsits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it\nwith a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your\ncurrently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving\nWord's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-\nout wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone\nunless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look\nlike you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from\nyour Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't\ndetect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone\ndevoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!\nIt's a beautiful thing.

And, matching the \nweather, your representatives are heatedly working to improve the Wall Street \nmess. Letï¿½s hope they donï¿½t make it worse. Jennifer Hickey tells all in her \nrevealing Washingtonï¿½s Week piece http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html. And Zoli Simon has discovered that the Chinese have targeted Russian cruise \nmissiles at U.S. ships. Read all about it \nhttp://insightmag.com/news/258778.html. And guess which party is poised to \nbecome a major force in time for the November elections? Hint ï¿½ Itï¿½s not the \nRepublicans or Democrats http://insightmag.com/news/258781.html. Along with the \nusual reliable revelations and opinions described below. ï¿½Bye for now. >>From the \nBunker, I remain your newsman in Washington................................................CHINA ARMS FOR WARZoli Simon writes that China's acquisition of cruise-missile weapons systems \nfrom Russia poses a clear and present danger to U.S. naval forces ï¿½ and to the \nAmerican homeland as well.http://insightmag.com/news/258778.html...............................................WASHINGTONï¿½S WEEK ï¿½ ON THE LEGISLATIVE WARPATHJennifer Hickey tells us as investor anger registered more clearly with each \ndownward tick of the stock markets, legislators engaged in an indelicate \nparliamentary exchange of whoops about arcane congressional rules while they \ndanced and ululated to mutual charges of chicanery.http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html...............................................TAX CODE TRAUMAJohn Berlau tells us that experts contend that simplifying the U.S. tax code \nwould do more to cut down on corporate-accounting chicanery than the \nintroduction of still more regulations and criminal penalties.http://insightmag.com/news/258763.html ========================================               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from \nBeijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban \nhad ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that \nOsama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art \nair defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by \nMuslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director \nGeorge Tenet received a coded \"red alert\" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv \nheadquarters that presented what he called a \"worst case scenario\" -- that China \nwould use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  \nVHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s\n \nBetamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better\nquality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,\n1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the\nfilm rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. \"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the\nmarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to\nsecure parts,\" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the\nformat. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the\ntelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin\nfor Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of\ncompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,\nalthough VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no\nnew ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies. \n  See also:\n \n------------------------ Yahoo!

) from jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) : ) one of the largest , most popular choruses in seattle regularly ) has a sign-language \" interpreter \" on stage during performances ; the ) particular one who has been doing it for a long time is not deaf ; he seems ) to also appeal a lot to the general audience with his expressive , exaggerated ) style . ) from midori yonezawa ( yonezawa @ student . msu . edu ) : ) i believe that there is a sign singing contest because music can be shared ) by everybody and it is natural to want to show different expressions each ) other . ) i learned japanese sign language in japan ( a little bit ) , and sometimes i ) practiced sign singing , too . i went to concerts where the singers were ) all professional \" shanson \" singers ( \" shanson \" is french loan into japanese ) . ) they have a concert every year for those who are handicapped , not only ) for deaf people . some singers sang with sign language at the same time as ) they sang vocally , and when the singers did n't do so there was an interpreter ) of sign language on the stage . i noticed and surprised that the ways of ) expressing by sing language are very different from each other and from ) occasions , e . g . fast / slow , soft / pressing , emotional / calm , etc , etc . . ) i also remember a tv program ( on nhk ) about equipment to help those who have ) difficulty in hearing . a technical group developed the equipment so that ) they can hear music . ) from peggy swartzel lott ( pslott @ utxvms . cc . utexas . edu ) : ) when i was a sign language interpreter and interpreter coordinator in ) san diego , california , there was quite a to-do a few years back over ) the issue of song sign . i first remember encountering song sign in ) the early to mid 70 's when a few groups of deaf performers ( i . e . ) musign ) toured the country performing popular songs in sign along ) with recorded sound tracks . later a pair of excellent performers , ) sharon neumann solow and gary sanderson , both individuals who were ) raised with deaf parents and fluent in asl , toured and performed ) songs in sign . ) ) the controversy in san diego centered on a local \" annual song sign ) competition \" hosted by the area 's rid branch , sanscrid . the ) competition was open to the public and was established both for ) a general \" deaf awareness \" activity and to raise funds for various ) purposes . prizes were given out for best individual song , best ) group , etc . the performance of the competition was quite popular ) and seemed to be growing in attendance and participation each year . ) ) a group of deaf people contested the competition on various grounds . ) the points i remember best about their objection ( because i ) personally found these issues most compelling ) were that the ) actual performances were offensive to some native signers because ) of the way putting sign to music distorted the linguistic and ) aesthetic dynamics of asl . that is , in order to make a signed ) narrative conform to the lyrics of a song , to translate it ) simultaneously with the recorded music , many grammatical patterns ) in normal signing had to be altered . often the performance bore ) little resemblance to normal signing . ) ) there was great debate for a while in the community over this issue . ) certain deaf people and many hearing interpreters and sign ) students defended the practice of song sign . some insisted that ) they be allowed to exercise their own artistic talents in playing ) with signing in this way . others felt that song sign provided an ) important bridge that enabled many uninformed hearing people to ) become aware of and appreciate the beauty of signing . the ) community was divided over the issue and eventuall y the whole ) thing was dropped . in the meantime , however , certain concerns ) of deaf people were brought to the surface and continued to be a ) source of discussion : issues about who has the right to make poetic ) use of signing and what sorts of alterations in signing style are ) acceptable to native users and which are not . i found the whole ) debate quite interesting and was genuinely convinced by the ) argument of the deaf people who were opposed to the practice . ) from richard arnold ( richard . arnold @ vuw . ac . nz ) : ) here in new zealand we have an annual new zealand sign langauge story - telling ) competition . mostly the competitors are deaf , but some codas also partipate as ) well . i have yet to see any hearing compete , however i know of some deaf for ) whom nz sign language is a second language learnt later in their adult life ) also participate . ) ) the winners are usually those who are quite fluent in nzsl . the criteria for ) judging is ( to my understanding ) as follows : ) ) - is the signing clear to the audience ? ) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called \" sweet honey in the ) rock \" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of \" helpers \" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst \" loss \" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like \" tra la la \" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who work in ) theater . musical productions , because of their general inclusion of ) dance ( a more interesting visual event ) and costume / props / etc . . . are ) quite popular and well-attended ( comparatively speaking ) by d / deaf ) theatre-goers . many thanks to all those who replied . randy lapolla institute of history and philology academia sinica",

      "text": "re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , \" forensic \" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = \" imperialism \" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of \" pre-linguistic \" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the \" barbarian \" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are \" natural \" or \" conventional \" / are there \" correct \" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures \" explain \" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the \" prehistory of linguistics \" , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji",

      "text": "re : summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just \" schiet op , man \" must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott delancey mats eeg-olofsson dom watt hilde hasselgard nicole nelson jane a . edwards sren harder charlie rowe nobue mori adiego lajara bruce connell krisadawan hongladarom frank bramlett deborah milam berkley douglas s oliver larry trask kristine hasund paul boersma m . lynne roecklein judy l . delin benji wald stephen p . spackman john verhaar randall major + the person who wished to be anonymous for the references .",

( this is a key difference between this agreement and the socal mou . ) the other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the puc . in other words , sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate sdg & e ' s undercollect just by dealing with the puc rather than the legislature . sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the socal mou to move in the legislature . sources also indicate that the earlier trans - elect offer to purchase sdg & e lines for ( $ 1 . 8 b ) considerably less than the states bid only makes the california legislature more leery of approving the socal mou . mou attached below . davis kindles new fire over dwr contracts friday ' s release of the cadwr power contracts motioned republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out . assembly member dave cox ( minority leader ) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties , and instead these would be paid by taxpayers . backlash from the republicans has been increasing as a new wave of california television commercials peg davis as the root of california ' s energy woes . ge out west sources report that there are 3 or 4 ge generator sets ( peaker plants ) on the market now for $ 14 - $ 15 m . this is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the california market because it is \" too arbitrary . \" sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report \" judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team \" reconsider \" the merits of bankruptcy . \" today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal could do equally well in the event of a filing . sources suggest that socal ' s current cash position weighs less heavily in determining a bankruptcy filing than the prospect of asset seizures / liens ( however , sources continue to make inquiries as to socal ' s cash flow situation . )",
