[{"text":"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2002/09/26/bono\nact.DTLOpening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,\na landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright\nlaw, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of\nothers.....To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet\nbookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will\nbring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,\nbefore arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,\nlibraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free\nhigh-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are\nalready in the public domain.--------I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and\nsaw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a\nsmall satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding\nmachine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a\ncopy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total\nfixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA\nhad the equipment donated) is under $10k.One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if\nthey wished, add these \"virtual holdings\" (public domain materials) to their\nexisting library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford.

http://boingboing.net/#85534626\nDate: Not suppliedAfter discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven \n\"Hackers\" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the \nlegality and ethics of using open wireless access points.     I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed \n    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. \"The FBI wouldn't \n    waste resources on that,\" he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would \n    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel \n    illegal. Becauseï¿½and this is the point of all that war-driving and \n    -chalking and node-stumblingï¿½when you get used to wireless, the experience \n    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe \n    bandwidth like oxygenï¿½and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

be in the thousands . two us \" critical infrastructures \" - - transportation and finance - - the cornerstones of the us economy have been severely damaged . 2 . discount all gossip . responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility . there are no facts at this time . 3 . nonetheless , there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton . indeed , it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack . 4 . it is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the middle east . it is almost equally certain that a massive us response against a middle eastern target is forthcoming . there will be enormous domestic political pressure on the bush administration for a vengeance attack . this will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame arab radicalism in the middle east and persian gulf . 5 . as mentioned above , in addition to the horrendous human cost , there are economic and market consequences : oil - ipe and nymex are closed . oil futures will of course react strongly to the dramatic uptick in middle eastern uncertainty . equities - general flight to quality . investors are selling equities and putting funds into cash . many major brokerages and trading firms have been wiped out in the wtc collapse . it will take some time - - days or weeks - - for these firms to restore operations . currencies - swiss franc and us dollar will benefit from flight to quality . shipping - major ports and border crossing closed , surrounding areas jammed with traffic . impact on all commodities - - steel , lumber , pulp / paper , crude /

with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers

replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.-h>From: \"Rob Shavell\"

, call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site

   Date:        Wed, 28 Aug 2002 09:22:34 -0500\n    From:        Chris Garrigues \n    Message-ID:  <1030544555.28815.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>\n  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist\n    foreach m $rseq {\n        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {\n            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found\n            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]\n            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]\n        } else {\n            # Real hack\n            break\n        }\n    }which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch\nof messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the\nfirst message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any\nof the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,\nand I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the\nsequences it is looking at, all the time...It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current\nfolder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the\ndirectory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the\ncontext file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.  | I'll email anything I figure out since I'm

my last auditing in the in london , uk we realized the sum $ 35 . 5 million owned by one patric zuma from egypt who died in a fatal motor accident in nov . 15 , 2004 while he was away on vacation in egypt . all efforts , made to reach the relatives of mr . patric zuma for the past two years , have not yielded any positive result . it was later gathered that mr . zuma ? s divorced wife died some two years ago in gaza . in our last board meeting , the directors jointly decided that mr . zuma ? s money should be included in the annual profit for the year 2005 . since i was the one who introduced mr . zuma to the bank , i objected to the decision and demanded that the fund remains floating in the treasury for another one year to see if we could actually get the relatives of mr . zuma to claim the money . i am seeking your partnership to transfer this funds to your account for your co - operation and assistance i willcompensate you with 25 % 70 % percent for me and 5 % set aside for any saundry expenses . with your consent , we will put up a claim on your behalf as next of kin to mr . zuma , iwill send you all the documents to you . once this is done , the claims & verification dept will have the funds processed and wired to your account , then we can meet to share the money together . please i want you to keep this information very confidential as the exposure of this information might even lead to my life imprisonment or death . if you are not willing to assist me , then i will beg you to still keep the informations secret . let me have your telephone

phonetics and phonology ( chiphon ) 98 call chiphon - - the phonetics and phonology group at the university of chicago - - provides a forum for discussing fundamental questions in spoken language research . last year , over 100 people joined us for a day-long panel on whether speech is special . this year , as part of the 34th annual meeting of the chicago linguistic society , we examine how language acquisition data should be incorporated into phonological and phonetic theory . chiphon ' 98 saturday , april 18 , chicago , illinois the acquisition of spoken language \" the ideal relationship between central and developmental portions of a field would be one in which the investigators in each . . . would construct model children who were capable of developing into adults and , conversely , model adults who could have developed from children \" ( menn , 1980 ) . * which provides a better measure of a speaker 's successful acquisition of speech - - perceiving contrasts or producing them ? how are perception & production related to linguistic competence ? * how should acquisition data be used when formulating and evaluating phononological theories of tone and stress ? what are the prosodic primitives , and are they innate or can they be bootstrapped from the signal ? * what speech processing mechanisms are responsible for second-language development ? are they the same as those for adults processing l1 or for infants acquiring it ? what does disordered phonology tell us about these mechanisms ? we invite abstracts that treat the acquisition of spoken language as integral to the development of linguistic theory . invited speakers : james flege ( university of alabama at birmingham ) peter jusczyk ( johns hopkins university ) robert port ( indiana university ) conference info like last year , this year 's symposium will provide ample opportunities for discussion with talks throughout the day , a box lunch , and an hour-long discussion at the end . other events that weekend include a panel on language acquisition and the lexicon on april 19 . * sophisticated connectionist models of language and acquisition provide an ideal framework for constructing linguistic theories that incorporate the complex interactions between sounds , symbols and meanings . * the ways in which we conceptualize the organization of morphology have different implications for first and for second language acquisition . * ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny and for mature organisms we look at lexical access convinced cognition then recapitulates ontogeny . invited speakers : joan bybee ( university of new mexico ) david pisoni ( indiana university ) terry regier ( university of chicago ) the cls conference will also host a panel on the status of constraints in linguistic theory on april 17 , with john mccarthy and jerrold sadock . papers on phonology , morphology , and syntax , among others , will be presented during the main sessions on april 17-19 , with

And after reading the phrase for what seemed like\nthe umpteen-thousandth time, we were idly wondering how many Irish\ntech companies blamed their misfortunes \"on the global downturn\":\nhttp://makeashorterlink.com/?S35A63392Oh, so it's about 450 then.  Thanks, Google.*The death occurred recently of that great Irish washtub musician\nLonnie Donegan.  RIP.  This seems like an apt time therefore to\nreflect on his many accomplishments: his virtuoso playing of\nutensil-based instruments, his worldwide commercial success, his\nplace in history as King of Skiffle, and how he wiped billions of\nyen off the value of the Tokyo stock market:\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?selm=373A9C4F.61B@time.life\n(\"panic and subsequent 10+% decline of Tokyo Stock Exchange when Reuters\nadvised 'Lonnie Donnegan' was dead\")\nand also at\nhttp://xsls.com?80\n(\"to Japanese ears it sounded like Ronald Reagan\").*UCD's Literary and Historical Society this week awarded an honorary\nfellowship to the tediously brilliant American multidisciplarian Dr\nNoam Chomsky.  Now the idea of some trifling college society\nawarding a mere honorary fellowship actually sounds rather like an\ninsult to us, considering that Niall Quinn and Marian Finucane were\ngiven *degrees* by DIT the very next day, but then Chomsky\napparently inspired some of Radiohead's most caterwaulingly blunted\nsongs, so we suppose it serves him right.  Anyway, if you're an\nadmirer of the great man's hermeutic genius, linguistic philosophy\nor contentious views on US foreign policy, perhaps you might also\nappreciate his amazing interview of Tom Hanks:\nhttp://www.sadiethepilot.com/aaweb/tapes.htm#tomnnoamVery special thanks to IMHO's London correspondent Ray Butler for\nthis one.*Key IMHO contributor Sean Lynch quite realistically predicts a post-\nBudget dole queue for all of us, and wonders if we'll miss those\ncash-and-job cow multinationals when they're gone?   Not if their\nIrish presence was as permanent and impressive as \"the world's\nleading risk and insurance services firm\", he concludes:\nhttp://www.marsh.ie\n(compare and contrast with, say, http://www.marsh.co.uk/)*Also: we've been remiss in the past in not featuring\nEircomTribunal.com's stalwart and righteous campaigning against\nEircom's crippling rates and crippled infrastructure in this\ncountry.  Well, we aim to redress that right now, by pointing out\n(1) Their 'Banana Republic' international price comparison page at\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/dossier_banana_rep.html, which will\nsurely make you mad enough to\n(2) Download and print out their marvellously bitter \"No More\nFavours For You, Mr Eircom Employee\" flyer from\nhttp://www.eircomtribunal.com/counterstrike_a2_nomore.html, designed\nto be stuck under the windshields of the ubiquitous and bilious\nblue/orange Eircom vans.\nNow if only EircomTribunal.com could somehow could retrieve that\nmoney we all lost on bloody Eircom shares...\n                          * * * * * * * * *\nIMHO'S PICK: JOB....................IMHO HO HO (AND A BOTTLE OF RUM)\"FATHER CHRISTMAS on a bike - Student - Giving out FREEBIES - Four\nweeks\".

Disproving the stereotype that all accountants are boring:\nsome Dublin 2 company is looking for a \"Parti-time bookkeeper\" at\nhttp://xsls.com?83*Our attention-deficient gaze also fell briefly this week onto a box\nad in a Sunday paper which is seeking private investors for an\nADVENTURE SPORTS RETAILING business in Dublin.  Now this probably\njust means selling snowboards or something equally tame, but in our\nimagination we see IMHO readers hunting elephants, dogfighting in\nbiplanes over the Wicklow Hills and abseiling down moon craters.\nJust in case we're right, any \"smart, experienced partner/investor\"\nlooking for an \"equity stake/board position\" should \"express\"\n\"interest\" to neptune@atomic.ie.You know, it might look like we're giving these people free\nadvertising, but by putting their email addresses on the public web,\nwe're actually GUARANTEEING them spam...\n                          * * * * * * * * *\nIMHO'S PICK: EVENT...........................Allow Us To DemonstrateFriday is BUY NOTHING DAY.  For the sake of your own mental health\nand the socio-economic future, we urge you to give it a try.  It's\nnot that hard to get through 24 hours without a purchase, and those\ncorporate balance sheets sure look funny with a big pre-Christmas\nhole in them.The official home of BND is of course Adbusters\n(http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/) and they have a run-down of\nIrish activities at http://xsls.com?84... rather a disappointing line-up\nat this late stage, although the Zombie-Shopping in Galway sounds\nlike fun - shame they're moving the day to Saturday, hopefully it's\nnot for purpose-defeating reasons (\"Friday?  Damn, I'm working the\nlate shift at McDonald's... how about Saturday?\").  In addition and\nelsewhere you can expect bring-and-trade markets, flypostering, free\nstuff, public speaking and all the other happy faces of democratic\nconsumer agitation.  Punk's not dead!  Party for your right to\nfight!  No Logo!  Hare Hare!  And so on.*We're now going to risk life and limb by mentioning an event which\nis so diametrically opposed to the above that we might just bring\nabout the heat-death of the Internet by combining them in the one\nnewsletter.We speak of course of the benighted and spiritually-denuded sickness\nof the TRILOGY FASHION SHOW in the RDS on December 4th, tickets\nstarting at \"just E50\" (but rising to E395 + VAT, natch).  The\nadvertising for this bleak celebration focuses entirely on \"the most\nbeautiful women in the world\" who will grace the Simmonscourt\nPavilion with their airbrushed emptiness: Tyra Banks, Sophie Dahl\nand Anna Kournikova (not the virus) are the only names we recognise.\nYou have to pore pretty closely over the small print of the press\nads to divine that it's the \"new Escada Collection\" (the who now?)\nthey're modelling.  And in an utterly appropriate and inevitable\npartnership, tickets are available from the cultural sewage\ntreatment system that is Ticketmaster.\nhttp://www.cslassociates.ie/events/trilogy_fashion.htm\n                          * * * * * * * * *\nIMHO'S PICK: DOWNLOAD..................Transparent and UnaccountableGiven our internet focus and the subversive nature of our scurrilous\npublishing agenda, there is only one possible download\nrecommendation this week.  It's the brilliant GHOSTZILLA browser, a\ncreation of architectural genius which brings office escapism to\nheady new heights.Designed to facilitate inconspicuous worktime browsing, Ghostzilla\nsits quietly and invisibly in the background until you summon it\nwith a special mouse movement.  It then adapts itself to your\ncurrently-uppermost application, for example Micro$oft Word, leaving\nWord's toolbars intact while showing web pages in a subtle grayed-\nout wash in the main window.  Images appear in a subdued two-tone\nunless you summon them, and the overall effect is to make it look\nlike you're working exactly as you should be.  A casual glance from\nyour Office Space boss as he paces past your cubicle shouldn't\ndetect anything that looks like browsing.  To think that someone\ndevoted their life to creating something so wonderfully juvenile!\nIt's a beautiful thing.

The final's on at the same time tomorrow.\nCalm down from all that excitement with the laughable one-hour FAIR\nCITY murder trial special (RTE1, 20:00) - it's quite brilliant how\nthe risible scripts really bring out the absolute worst in truly\nterrible actors.  Settle down with a few G&Ts to watch PRIME TIME on\nthe same channel at 21:30, where they're discussing Ireland's\nalcoholic epidemic and its attendant social problems, or waste them\non either the bottom-scraping POLICE ACADEMY 3 (N2, 21:30) or the\ngeriatric 1978 blockbuster COMA (TG4, 22:05).Friday night, and after a hard day of buying nothing you can flop in\nfront of creepy Hitler doco SIX MOST EVIL MEN (N2, 21:00).  Near as\nwe can tell, the other evil men are Macauley Culkin in UNCLE BUCK\n(TV3, 20:00), gossip columnist WINCHELL in a solid eponymous biopic\n(N2, 21:30), the big boss bad guy - is it Kang? Kane? Cowen? - in\nMORTAL KOMBAT (TG4, 21:25), Mel Gibson in predictable 80s drug\nthriller TEQUILA SUNRISE (RTE1, 23:50), and Quentin Tarantino\njumping on his own bandwagon in DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO (TV3,\n0:50).  Hang on, Dave Fanning might be one of the evil men too: he's\npresenting THE LAST BROADCAST on Network 2 at 23:35.\n                          * * * * * * * * *\nCOLOPHON....................................................APOLOGIAWe'd like to focus mainly on the IRISH Internet, but, uh, we were\nsick that day.

facilities as a follow up to our meeting last week with colleen on the ardmore facility , i had a conversation this morningwith richard sanders concerning the status of the settlement negotiations with dynegy concerning northern natural gas . i understand from richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow enron corp to continue to lease the ardmore facility as a data center . i just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow enron to provide space to netco for its hardware during a transition period until netco can relocate its hardware to a new data center . the lease also needs to make it clear that access to the ardmore facility needs to be under enron ' s control . similarily the software license that enron will retain covering all the enron developed software will also need to provide that enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as aep , bridgeline and northern natural gas . if anyone has any

book to further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america ' s velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital , we have decided to create a capital book . the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner . the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas , with any form of capital requirement , are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge . the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets . therefore , on any assets currently held within each business area , the capital charge will remain at 15 % . internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below . the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe . this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged . capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15 % . transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15 % across the board charge . transactions which are structured off balance sheet , but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america ' s overall credit capacity . on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books , the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction , similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve . this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction . as noted above , the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination

fortean, but a moment in time all the same...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm\nBetamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after\nlosing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. \nBetamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000\nmore machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  \nVHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s\n \nBetamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better\nquality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,\n1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the\nfilm rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. \"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the\nmarket, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to\nsecure parts,\" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the\nformat. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the\ntelevision and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin\nfor Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of\ncompetition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,\nalthough VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no\nnew ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies. \n  See also:\n \n------------------------ Yahoo!

write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!\ny.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am

However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent

: sign-singing a few weeks ago i posted the following query : ) here in taiwan there is a tv program in which people compete ) to see who is the best singer . there are different categories ) for different types of songs / languages , etc . , and one category ) is for \" sign singing \" . a tape of a song is played , and a signer ) signs along with the words of the song ( all those i ' ve seen ) compete were not deaf ) . i was wondering if this is common in ) other countries , and if so , what the criteria are for judging ) who is \" the best \" , and also if it is done at all by people ) who are deaf . thanks . i received a number of interesting responses : ) from jane edwards ( edwards @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) : ) thought not pertaining to contests or even singing , for that matter , ) i saw something on pbs a couple months back which i wanted to mention . ) they showed a \" music appreciation \" class taught to totally deaf high school ) kids , in which they each were wearing pad on the back , which converts the ) acoustic output into pressure stimulation . the students were dancing to ) the music , and commenting on different types of music . they were n't ) singing / signing to it , but perhaps they could ? ) from jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) : ) one of the largest , most popular choruses in seattle regularly ) has a sign-language \" interpreter \" on stage during performances ; the ) particular one who has been doing it for a long time is not deaf ; he seems ) to also appeal a lot to the general audience with his expressive , exaggerated ) style . ) from midori yonezawa ( yonezawa @ student . msu . edu ) : ) i believe that there is a sign singing contest because music can be shared ) by everybody and it is natural to want to show different expressions each ) other . ) i learned japanese sign language in japan ( a little bit ) , and sometimes i ) practiced sign singing , too . i went to concerts where the singers were ) all professional \" shanson \" singers ( \" shanson \" is french loan into japanese ) . ) they have a concert every year for those who are handicapped , not only ) for deaf people . some singers sang with sign language at the same time as ) they sang vocally , and when the singers did n't do so there was an interpreter ) of sign language on the stage . i noticed and surprised that the ways of ) expressing by sing language are very different from each other and from ) occasions , e . g . fast / slow , soft / pressing , emotional / calm , etc , etc . . ) i also remember a tv program ( on nhk ) about equipment to help those who have ) difficulty in hearing . a technical group developed the equipment so that ) they can hear music . ) from peggy swartzel lott ( pslott @ utxvms . cc . utexas . edu ) : ) when i was a sign language interpreter and interpreter coordinator in ) san diego , california , there was quite a to-do a few years back over ) the issue of song sign . i first remember encountering song sign in ) the early to mid 70 's when a few groups of deaf performers ( i . e . ) musign ) toured the country performing popular songs in sign along ) with recorded sound tracks . later a pair of excellent performers , ) sharon neumann solow and gary sanderson , both individuals who were ) raised with deaf parents and fluent in asl , toured and performed ) songs in sign . ) ) the controversy in san diego centered on a local \" annual song sign ) competition \" hosted by the area 's rid branch , sanscrid . the ) competition was open to the public and was established both for ) a general \" deaf awareness \" activity and to raise funds for various ) purposes . prizes were given out for best individual song , best ) group , etc . the performance of the competition was quite popular ) and seemed to be growing in attendance and participation each year . ) ) a group of deaf people contested the competition on various grounds . ) the points i remember best about their objection ( because i ) personally found these issues most compelling ) were that the ) actual performances were offensive to some native signers because ) of the way putting sign to music distorted the linguistic and ) aesthetic dynamics of asl . that is , in order to make a signed ) narrative conform to the lyrics of a song , to translate it ) simultaneously with the recorded music , many grammatical patterns ) in normal signing had to be altered . often the performance bore ) little resemblance to normal signing . ) ) there was great debate for a while in the community over this issue . ) certain deaf people and many hearing interpreters and sign ) students defended the practice of song sign . some insisted that ) they be allowed to exercise their own artistic talents in playing ) with signing in this way . others felt that song sign provided an ) important bridge that enabled many uninformed hearing people to ) become aware of and appreciate the beauty of signing . the ) community was divided over the issue and eventuall y the whole ) thing was dropped . in the meantime , however , certain concerns ) of deaf people were brought to the surface and continued to be a ) source of discussion : issues about who has the right to make poetic ) use of signing and what sorts of alterations in signing style are ) acceptable to native users and which are not . i found the whole ) debate quite interesting and was genuinely convinced by the ) argument of the deaf people who were opposed to the practice . ) from richard arnold ( richard . arnold @ vuw . ac . nz ) : ) here in new zealand we have an annual new zealand sign langauge story - telling ) competition . mostly the competitors are deaf , but some codas also partipate as ) well . i have yet to see any hearing compete , however i know of some deaf for ) whom nz sign language is a second language learnt later in their adult life ) also participate . ) ) the winners are usually those who are quite fluent in nzsl . the criteria for ) judging is ( to my understanding ) as follows : ) ) - is the signing clear to the audience ? ) - does the signer get the audiences attention ? ) - is the story well structured ? ) - is the story within the time limits set ( usually 3 minutes ) ? ) - does the signer keep to the rules ? ) this usually consists of - no dirty jokes . ) - no overzealous religious contexts . ) ) the competitior must give a title to his / her story and state its type , ( ie true ) story , joke story , sad story , not true story etc . . . ) ) ) if the story exceeds the time limit a point is deducted . however the signer is ) not interrupted if he / she exceeds the limit but is allowed to complete the ) story ( unless it really is too long ! ! ! ) . ) ) sometimes , at the end the winner ( if he / she is popular with the audience is ) asked to repeat it or give another story ) . ) ) . . . sign-singing is not too common among the deaf community far as i am ) aware . it is mostly done in religious situations . i think it is n't a strong ) component of deaf culture . however story-telling is a strong part of deaf ) culture and especially of making jokes and light-hearted teasing . anyway thats ) my deaf experience here in new zealand . ) from karina bingham ( karina @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaii . edu ) : ) there is an african - american a cappella group called \" sweet honey in the ) rock \" who have a full-time signer in the group . she performs with them and ) signs her interpretations of the songs . they recently published a book ) for their 25th anniversary : ) ) reagon , bernice johnson . the long journey home . 1994 . ) ) in which the signer discusses her experiences in the deaf community and ) a deaf church ( where the congregation sang in sign ) . her parents were both ) deaf ; she is not . ) from marina mcintire ( mmcintir @ lynx . dac . neu . edu ) : ) you have inadvertently touched upon a very tender issue in the deaf ) community here in the us . first , let me say that only in the us have i ) seen this phenomenon . brits ( both deaf and hearing who work with them ) ) are confounded and amused by it . in the us , it used to be quite the ) thing to translate songs and develop routines to go with them , produce ) recitals and concerts , and the like . it arose , most likely , out of a ) strong church-related tradition of \" helpers \" for deaf people . ) ) in the last ten to fifteen years , however , deaf people have begun their ) own liberation . song - signing has been a casualty , by and large . it is ) viewed as representing one aspect of a pathological or clinical view of ) deafness , i . e . , that the worst \" loss \" resulting from deafness is music . ) this is , of course , far from the truth . and for culturally deaf people , ) music is a peculiarity belonging to the mainstream hearing world and of ) no consequence in their lives whatsoever . so * that * motive ( helping ) d / deaf people appreciate what they ' re missing ) is not acceptable . ) ) another complaint is that , by and large , translations are more ) influenced by the rhythm of the music than by any sense it might make in ) asl , presenting d / deaf audiences with nonsensical or distorted versions ) of signs and signed syntax . this arises partly , of course , out of the ) difficulty of translating any poetry into any language . ) ) worst of all , and perhaps most puzzling to d / deaf people , is the ) insistence of most song-signers on including things like \" tra la la \" or ) humming . there is * nothing * that could make less sense to a d / deaf ) audience ! ) ) i will say that i have seen some wonderful song-sign translations done , ) including some with rather elegant dance routines . sometimes these have ) been done by d / deaf people and sometimes by hearing folks . by and large , ) however , this practice is no longer an acceptable pasttime in our ) community . exceptions are made , ironically , for interpreters who

classifications of the nilotic languages . karimojong is actually a member of \" the other branch of nilotic which includes maasai and kalenjin \" . this branch , termed nilo - hamitic by some , and paranilotic by tucker and bryan was divided into two groups by oswin koehler in 1955 as part of a tripartite division of the nilotic language - - western ( dinka , nuer , shilluk , achooli , lango , dholuo ) , eastern ( maasai , karimojong , turkana , etc . ) , southern ( kalenjin , datooga ) . greenberg saw the correctness of koehler 's classification and adopted it . it is accepted by all today . it is also worth noting that there were scholars , such as tucker and bryan , who , although they did not accept the connection with \" hamitic \" , did feel that there was sufficient evidence to connect southern and eastern in a group ( the old nilo - hamitic or paranilotic ) . tucker and bryan believed that these languages were nilotic ( or would ultimately be shown to be nilotic , so the question was really whether the tree was : / | \\ or / \\ / \\ the evidence for the paranilotic subgrouping was syntactic ( vso word order ) , morphological type ( particularly the fairly elaborate

I've been trying out RedHat Limbo for a few weeks now, \nequipped with gcc 3.1. I haven't fallen foul of compiler issue so far, \nthat I'm aware of anyhow. That said I'm glad I don't do much C++ - seems \npretty much every version of gcc (2.95, 2.96, 3.0, 3.1, and the \nforthcoming 3.2) breaks C++ binary compatibility in some way or other.Paul.\n--

: 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , \" forensic \" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = \" imperialism \" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of \" pre-linguistic \" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the \" barbarian \" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are \" natural \" or \" conventional \" / are there \" correct \" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures \" explain \" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own

: summary : ' no ' and ' man ' thanks for all the responses . it was really something to get the number and quality of ideas . 1 . ' no ' my initial query was : south african english use of ' no ' - does this occur in contexts such as : a . how are you ? b . no , i ' m fine . in other english varieties / other languages ? confronted with such examples , vistors to the country often comment that in sa english , ' no ' means ' yes ' . this , of course , is not true . ' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit . ' empty ' ) - spanish ? it also occurs , incidentally , in afrikaans . 2 . ' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just \" schiet op , man \" must do ) . ' some interesting stuff came out as you can see . just for your interest , on further sa english item : - ' sorry ' for ' i beg your pardon ' e . g . a drops something without knowing . b picks it up and calls out to a ' sorry , you dropped something ' anyway thanks to : helen adamson geoffrey sampson elin haf gruffyd jones celso alvarez caccamo mai kuha mark donohue marek przezdziecki scott

update 6 / 19 / 01 executive summary ? angelides to announce bridge loan financing ? us senate democrats go back & forth with ferc ? sdg & e line sale overview ? california dwr contracts add tension ? ge accommodates western power sellers ? pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy angelides to announce bridge loan financing as reported on the wires and confirmed by sources , state treasurer , angelides will announce a $ 4 . 3 b bridge loan today at 2 pm pst . the majority of the loan will be provided by j . p . morgan chase and lehman brothers . us senates withdraws price cap legislation , almost in response to yesterday ' s ferc order , the senate energy committee chairman bingaman , and california us senators feinstein and boxer have decided to temporarily withdraw legislation aimed at setting wholesale power price caps in western states . the action displays an effort by lawmakers to acknowledge both bush ' s and ferc ' s meek spirit of cooperativeness and allow some time to determine the order ' s effectiveness . at least one legislator remains unsatisfied as sources report that sen . gordon smith ( r - oregon ) plans to author a bill by july that would attempt to extend the one year term on yesterdays ferc order to cover the northwest ' s power shortages winter 2002 . acknowledging the seasonal power swap between california and its northern neighbors , smith views current mitigation plan covering two california summers , and only one northwest winter , as unfair . sdg & e line sale through this deal , sempra and the state assert that san diego gas & electric ' s $ 750 m undercollect can be eliminated without a state purchase of sdg & e ' s transmission assets , which is the only element of the deal that would have to be approved by the legislature . ( this is a key difference between this agreement and the socal mou . ) the other tenets of the deal would only have to be approved by the puc . in other words , sempra claims that it will be able to eliminate sdg & e ' s undercollect just by dealing with the puc rather than the legislature . sources suggest that this may be in reaction to the failure of the socal mou to move in the legislature . sources also indicate that the earlier trans - elect offer to purchase sdg & e lines for ( $ 1 . 8 b ) considerably less than the states bid only makes the california legislature more leery of approving the socal mou . mou attached below . davis kindles new fire over dwr contracts friday ' s release of the cadwr power contracts motioned republicans to begin a new wave of complaints against the governor remarking that the contract information was lacking and data that the public has a right to know had been blacked out . assembly member dave cox ( minority leader ) stated that the most troubling items were the clauses that exempt generators from having to pay windfall profit taxes or environmental penalties , and instead these would be paid by taxpayers . backlash from the republicans has been increasing as a new wave of california television commercials peg davis as the root of california ' s energy woes . ge out west sources report that there are 3 or 4 ge generator sets ( peaker plants ) on the market now for $ 14 - $ 15 m . this is because the people who bought these units do not want to go forward and get into the california market because it is \" too arbitrary . \" sources report that the sellers of these generator sets made this decision beginning approximately a week ago . additionally , sources believe that ge may move to cost - plus - based pricing for sellers of power in order to provide stable financing for generators over the long term , though this would mean less profits than in the past . pg & e executives profit even in bankruptcy as reported on 6 - 14 , sources continue to believe that socal executives are closely following the events unfolding in the pg & e bankruptcy case , as mentioned in last thursday ' s report \" judge montali approved large bonuses for pg & e senior management after pg & e ' s filing made bryson and other members of his team \" reconsider \" the merits of bankruptcy . \" today ' s news reports of judge montali ' s order providing pg & e executive with $ 17 . 5 m in bonuses just reiterates the point to bryson that pg & e executives remain well - paid even in bankruptcy thus suggesting socal

It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little more suspicious of very high upward revisions.At least that was my take.I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec people prior to Cortez.

: the conservation of endangered languages the centre for theories of language and learning university of bristol department of philosophy announces a seminar on the conservation of endangered languages friday april 21st 1995 at 9 woodland rd , bristol bs8 1tb , england according to reliable estimates , half of the world 's six thousand languages will become extinct in the next century . furthermore , two thousand of the remaining three thousand languages will be threatened during the century after next . in the uk these startling facts have recently received media attention , stimulated partly by the publication this year of the atlas of the world 's languages , edited by christopher moseley and r . e . asher ( routledge ) . the rapid decline is largely due to a mixture of economic and political pressures affecting communities that speak minority languages , pressures which remove the new generation 's motivation for communicating in their traditional language . the problem of language-extinction raises fundamental questions . what is the value of these threatened languages to science and to humankind in general ? what principles might justify us in striving to keep small languages alive ? what reasons are there for preserving them in archive form ? the seminar is aimed primarily at academics from such disciplines as philosophy , ethics , anthropology , linguistics , sociolinguistics , cultural history , ecology and population biology , but is open to all interested persons . seminar programme registration desk opens 9 . 30a . m . 10-11 am mapping

it . further , have those hypotheses any useful predictive value ? what i mean is this : they may be significant at 99 . 99 % confidence level and beyond , yet remain useless . example : having recorded the outcomes of 100 , 000 spins at the roulette table , you find 50 . 5 % red and 49 . 5 % black , grab you pocket calculator , and yes , yes , yes , that particular roulette wheel must be biased towards red . with dreams of untold riches prodding you , you start betting on red . you might realize now that you after all you are not going to get very rich very quickly with just a 0 . 5 %
